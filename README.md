# NREM240_pmoore
This is an example repo setup for students of NREM 240 at Iowa State University. Assignments, files, data, and other information are in Canvas. This space is for students wishing to see how a working repo is organized that enables one to use RStudio using Binder as a gateway to JupyterHub.
Much of the procedure follows the workflow described in Zero to Binder [https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/communication/binder/zero-to-binder.html].
